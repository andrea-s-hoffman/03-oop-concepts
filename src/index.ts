// the 4 basic concepts of OOP:
// - 1. Abstraction: Only present data that is relevant or essential & hiding details within a class/object
// - 2. Encapsulation: Keeping all attributes and behaviors together within the given scope of a class/object
// - 3. Inheritance: subclasses (children) inherit all attributes and behaviors of the superclass (parent)
// - 4. Polymorphism...

// POLYMORPHISM -------------------------------
// Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
// examples of this include a subclass overriding its parent methods
// as it relates to TypeScript, we can describe an object by the parent class even if it was constructed from the child class

// interfaces can also contain methods
// ...

// interfaces simply describe an object, it will not create one (we have to do that manually)
// ...

// classes can be described by interfaces using the "implements" keyword (rather than "extends")
// ...

// we can describe an object by the parent class even if it was constructed from the child class
// ...
